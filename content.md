### What is Bitters?

You're looking at Bitters right now.

Bitters is a simple-as possible Git-based website built with Express, Jade, Stylus and deployed using Node.js.

Bitters uses Git as a replacement for bulky CMSes. Use your favorite text editor to write, publish, and deploy your work to the web.

### Why Bitters?

Bitters came into being as a reaction to the ongoing frustration with 'user-friendly' website 'solutions'. 

We use Bitters because we know the only way to have the freedom to express ourselves online is to know our full stack.

Bitters acknowledges when we abstract away 'the hard stuff', we also lose the magic of publishing to the web. By learning how to deploy ourselves, we gain freedom and independence on the distributed web.

### What do I need to run Bitters?

You'll need a VPS (virtual private server) with root access running Linux or Mac OS X with Git and Node.js installed.

### What do I need to know?

Using Bitters you'll learn how to [use Git](http://git.gwenbell.com) to [deploy Node.js](http://deployno.de) to the distributed web. By the time you've deployed Bitters, you'll know how to use Node.js and Git for more than just maintaining your website. 

When you deploy Bitters, you'll have the leverage you need to finally get that raise or tech job in DUMBO you've always wanted.
